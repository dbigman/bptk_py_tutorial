    "# Overview Of The BPTK-Py Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial contain sample agent-based and System Dynamics models along with Jupyter notebooks that illustrate the features of the BPTK-Py framework. This tutorial is designed as a companion to the [BPTK-Py online documentation](http://bptk.transentis-labs.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Docker installed (e.g. Docker Desktop on MacOS or on Windows), follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the command line, move into a directory where you would like to store the BPTK-Py tutorial. \n",
    "2. Clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial.git```\n",
    "3. Run ```docker-compose up```\n",
    "4. Point your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) – this will open JupyterLab showing the contents of your directory. \n",
    "5. Open the notebook ```readme.ipynb``` from within JupyterLab.\n",
    "6. When you are finished, close your browser and call ```docker-compose down``` from within your directory. This will stop and remove the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the command line, move into a directory where you would like to store the BPTK-Py tutorial. \n",
    "2. Clone this repository: ```git clone https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial.git```\n",
    "3. Install a virtual environment in that directory: ```python3 -m venv venv```\n",
    "4. Activate the virtual environment: ```source venv/bin/activate``` (MacOS/Linux) or ``venv\\scripts\\activate.bat``` (Windows)\n",
    "5. Install the necessary python modules: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n",
    "6. Start JupyerLab: ```jupyter lab```\n",
