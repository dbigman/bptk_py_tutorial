    "Welcome to the BPTK-PY tutorial. This tutorial contain sample agent-based and System Dynamics models created using the BPTK-PY framework. The tutorial is designed as a companion to the [BPTK-Py online documentation](http://bptk.transentis-labs.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the tutorials is to illustrate how to use the BPTK-Py framework, not to introduce System Dynamics modeling or Agent-based modeling in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate the framework using a simple project management model and the Bass Diffusion model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Simple Project Management Model__. This model is an illustration of [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law), which states that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\n",
    "* __Bass Diffusion Model__. This model is an implementation of the [Bass diffusion model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model) originally created by [Frank Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Bass) that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The Bass model has been widely used in forecasting, especially new products' sales forecasting and technology forecasting.\n",

    "You can learn more about these models on our blog:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Step-by-step introduction to System Dynamics](https://www.transentis.com/step-by-step-tutorials/introduction-to-system-dynamics/) using the simple project management model.\n",
    "* Introduction to the [Bass Diffusion Model](https://www.transentis.com/causal-loop-diagramming/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an overview of the documents contained in this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Writing Computational Essays Using Simulation Models](bptk_py_introduction.ipynb). Introduction to using simulation models built with Â®Stella in Jupyter Notebooks using the BPTK-Py framework.\n",

    "* [In Depth Discussion Of The Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python](bptk_py_in_depth.ipynb) A discussion of how the BPTK-Py framework works and some of the advanced API features not covered in the other notebooks.\n",
    "* [The Architecture of the BPTK-Py Framework](bptk_py_architecture.ipynb) Explains the overall architecture of the BPTK-Py framework.\n",
    "* [How To: Creating User Defined Functions in SD Models](how_to_sd_user_defined_functions.ipynb) Explains how to create user defined functions in SD models.\n",
