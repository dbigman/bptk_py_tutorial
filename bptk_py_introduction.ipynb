    "## How to use Jupyter and Python to rapidly build interactive stories based on System Dynamics simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to use the insights gained from simulation models to transform your enterprise, just having the model and the insights alone are often not enough â€“ you need to develop a good story that persuades your stakeholders to make decisions and take action.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our BPTK_PY library allows you to convert System Dynamics models into Python code and run them in the powerful Jupyter notebook environment, which is a wonderful place for writing interactive, data-driven papers and reports.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our post [Telling Stories with System Dynamics Models](https://www.transentis.com/telling-stories-with-system-dynamics-models/) we introduced our approach to telling interactive stories based on simulation models built using System Dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing such interactive stories is quite challenging, even if your simulation model is already fairly complete, because you need to craft the storyline while testing different scenarios with the simulation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We realised early on that what we needed a \"interactive writing environment\" that would help us to prototype a complex story line while still building the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build an initial simulation model using a visual modeling tool.\n",
    "* Start writing a story around the model using the interactive writing environment.\n",
    "* Use the new questions and insights that arise during the writing process to drive experiments with the simulation model â€“ this may lead to changes in both the model and the storyline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014 we started writing such \"computational essays\" using [Wolfram Research'](http://www.wolfram.com) MathematicaÂ®. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematica is a wonderful and very powerful tool to support this process â€“ it is a complete environment that supports writing, computation, presentation and very sophisticated interactive dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematica does not contain native support for System Dynamics, but we crafted a small library that allows us to import System Dynamics models based on the XMILE standard and to run them in Mathematica (see this [blog post](https://www.transentis.com/building-interactive-stories-from-simulation-models/) for details on that).\n",
    "\n",
    "But since 2014 a lot has happened in the world of computational modelling ... Python has become the premiere programming language for data science and its use has thus become even more ubiquitous, and with it the [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) notebook environemnt (using the IPython kernel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Mathematica and Jupyter are fantastic environments for creating computational essays and \"story-driven simulations\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Working with Mathematica and the Wolfram Language is incredibly productive thanks to the symbolic nature of the language and the way it integrates into the highly sophisticated Mathematica notebook environment.\n",
    "* Currently Jupyter notebooks still lack the sophistication of Mathematica notebooks. But what sets the Jupyter/IPython ecosystem appart is that it is open source (and thus free to use for everyone), highly extensible and very widely used in the data science/computational modeling community - it is thus much easier to find books, training materials and skilled resources.\n",
    "\n",
    ">For a more in-depth comparison of Jupyter and Mathematica see Paul Romer's very interesting [blog post](https://paulromer.net/jupyter-mathematica-and-the-future-of-the-research-paper/) on this topic. Also be sure to read the [Atlantic Article](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) referenced by Paul Romer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Jupyter and Python are free to use, we decided to port our Business Prototyping Toolkit to the Jupyer/Python universe  and also provide it free of charge - which means you can now create simulation models using System Dynamics and let them run in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach is very powerful and liberating, because it turns our models into computable objects â€“ we can now use our simulation models in new ways, quite independently of the modeling environment in which we create the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some \"everyday\" examples of such uses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Writing up a report (or paper) based on a System Dynamics model using Jupyter and plotting all related graphs directly in Jupyter. \n",
    "* Creating and managing a comprehensive set of scenarios pertaining to that model.\n",
    "* Creating an interactive dashboard for a model.\n",
    "* Sharing models, dashboards and reports with people who do not have access to the original model environment.\n",
    "* Comparing multiple versions of a model to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide examples for all these points later in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced examples for using models as computable objects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* creating interactive games (see our version of the [Beergame](https://www.transentis.com/understanding-the-beer-game) and the computational essay that goes with it. We built the model underlying the game using System Dynamics and transpiled the model into Javascript using our Javascript transpiler),\n",
    "* performing monte-carlo sensitivity analysis of a model on multiple machines in parallel, using state-of-the art, scalable parallel processing engines such as [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org)\n",
    "* training machine learning algorithms using System Dynamics models.\n",
    "* combining system dynamics models with other computational model techniques, such as agent based modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are providing the BPTK PY framework as a closed source framework under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), which means you are free to use the framework in your own modeling projects. You can download the Jupyter Notebook and System Dynamics model corresponding to this blog post along with installation instructions and a more detailed tutorial in our [member area](https://www.transentis.com/member-area/) - please sign up to the member area first if you do not have an account yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate our computational essay approach using our BPTK PY framework we will use a very simple System Dynamics model. The System Dynamics model itself was built using the dynamic modeling and simulation software StellaÂ® from [iseesystems](http://www.iseesystems.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stella saves models using the [XMILE format](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=xmile), which is an open XML protocol for sharing interoperable system dynamics models and simulations. The XMILE standard is governed by the OASIS standards consortium - our framework currently only supports XMILE, we may create a compiler for other formats (such as VensimÂ® by [Ventana Systems](http://www.vensim.com)) in the future ([send us an email](mailto:support@transentis.com) if you are interested in this).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how our framework works, this post uses the model from our [Step-By-Step Introduction To System Dynamics](https://www.transentis.com/step-by-step-tutorials/introduction-to-system-dynamics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've included the stock and flow diagram of the entire model below â€“ you don't need to understand how the model works to follow this post, but knowing the stock and flow structure will be useful.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Importing The Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python comes with a model transpiler, which automatically converts SD-models created with [Stella](http://www.iseesystems.com) into Python Code, a model simulator which let's you run those models in a Python environment (such as a Jupyter notebook), a simple format for defining scenarios, and some methods to plot simulation results - these methods form the BPTK API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most users, this will be enough initialy: you create the model using Stella and experiment with it by defining scenarios and plotting graphs in Jupyter notebooks. Whenever you change the model in Stella, the model is automatically transpiled to Python in a background process. Hence you can work on your model (in Stella) and write your computational essay (in Jupyter) in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need very limited Python skills to do this â€“ the following sections show all the code that is needed to get up and running, our downloadable tutorial provides detailed installation instructions. we have found that even modelers who are new to Jupyter and Python can get productive with our toolkit within a few hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced users can use the full power of Jupyter and Python to access and manipulate the underlying simulation model and simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    ">For those of you that are new to Jupyter: Please run the code cells by pushing ``Shift + Enter``. The next code cell imports the BPTK_Py package and initializes it. This may take some time during the first run, because some necessary libraries will be downloaded from the [NPM repository](http://www.npmjs.org). "

    "This post detailed our approach to building interactive stories based on simulation models using Jupyter, Python and the BPTK_PY framewor. Here are the important points you should remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to use the insights gained from simulation models to have an impact in the real world, just having the model and the insights is often not enough â€“ you need to develop a good story that persuades your stakeholders to make decisions and take action.\n",
    "* Jupyter and Python provide a great environment for rapidly building such interactive stories that rely on data and on simulations. Using the BPTK_PY framework, creating such documents is actually quite easy. You can concentrate on the story and let the framework do the heavy lifting.\n",
    "* Building complex simulations using System Dynamics is best done using visual modeling environments such as Stella. Thanks to the XMILE standard and our BPTK PY framework, we can import System Dynamics models created with Stella straight into Jupyter and run them there.\n",
    "* Once you have finished the interactive story you can publish it to a wide audience by sharing the Jupyter notebook â€“ this is made particularly easy because Jupyter, Python and BPTK_PY are free.\n",
