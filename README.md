# BPTK_Py tutorial

This tutorial repository contains example notebooks, simulation models and scenarios to get started.

It uses an interactive approach to explain you how to work with the Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python.

## Contents

- [Introduction](bptk_py_introduction.ipynb): Basic information on BPTK-Py and first hints on how to plot
- [In Depth](bptk_py_indepth.ipynb): More detail on the SD plotting architecture, interactive dashboards and working with the simulation results
- [Model Check](model_check.ipynb): Short introduction to model checking capabilities of BPTK-Py
- [SD Intro](bptk_py_sd_intro.ipynb): A great introduction to our new Domain specific language for System Dynamics. It takes away all the complexity from creating simulation models within code. Supported from BPTK-Py version 0.4.0
