# BPTK_Py tutorial

Welcome to the BPTK_PY tutorials. These tutorials contain sample agent-based and System Dynamics models created using the BPTK_PY framework.

The objective of the tutorials is to illustrate how to use the BPTK_PY framework, not to introduce System Dynamics modeling or Agent-based modeling in general.

We illustrate the framework using a simple project management model and the Bass Diffusion model:

* __Simple Project Management Model__. This model is an illustration of [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law), which states that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
* __Bass Diffusion Model__. This model is an implementation of the [Bass diffusion model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model) originally created by [Frank Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Bass) that describes the process of how new products get adopted in a population. The Bass model has been widely used in forecasting, especially new products' sales forecasting and technology forecasting.

You can learn more about these models on our blog:
