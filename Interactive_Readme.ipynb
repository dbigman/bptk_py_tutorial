    "# Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python (and Jupyter Notebooks)\n",
    "The Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python comes with a model simulator, a tool for defining scenarios (Jupyter Notebook - TODO!) and some methods to plot simulation results, a so-called API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API for plotting simulation is really simple. It only exposes some methods that generate plots. The simulations run in the background every time you call a plot method. For long and large simulations, pleas bear with me and bring a few seconds of patience before I plot. ;-)\n",
    "All simulation scenarios have to be in the ``scenarios/`` folder. BPTK_Py will scan and load them - including the models - into python. Each API method comes with many parameters for modifying the graph. The standard settings however are in my config. They define the common \"transentis\" style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you only need the ``scenario_name`` (methods for one scenario)/ ``scenario_names`` (methods for a list of scenarios) and ``equation``/``equations`` parameters to get a working example. Of course you will probably want to define a title and labels for the x and y axis. Just look at the example method calls given to get a feel for the optional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Interactive Readme\n",
    "The interactive readme is designed to help you understand the API quickly. It is based on a simple Project Management model. We describe its equations and background in our [Blog Post](https://www.transentis.com/step-by-step-tutorials/introduction-to-system-dynamics/system-dynamics-simulation/). Have a look, understand the topic and come back.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us get started now. Before plotting, we have to setup some stuff.\n",
    "Please run the following lines to import the API to your notebook and ignore the warnings (if any). You run a line by pushing ``Shift + Enter``\n",
    "You will also get an overview over the available scenario managers and scenarios.\n",
