    "We love building computational models and our favorite environment for this kind of explorative, analytical work are [Jupyter](http://www.jupyter.org) and [Python](http://www.python.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make computational modeling easier we are developing the _Business Prototyping Toolkit for Python_ (BPTK PY), a simple library that currently supports System Dynamics and Agent-based modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first introduced the BPTK PY libary in our recent post [Writing Computational Essays Based On Simulation Models](https://www.transentis.com/writing-computational-essays-based-simulation-models/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then we've created some new functionality that allows you to build System Dynamics models and Agent-based models interactively in Jupyter using Python. To make model building as simple as possible, we have created a simple, domain-specific language (DSL) that supports both System Dynamics and Agent-based modeling and hides much of the underlying complexity of computational models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This language not only allows you to create System Dynamics models and Agent-based models, you can even mix the two to create \"hybrid\" simulation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having such a DSL is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build models interactively in Jupyter, making the modeling process very effective.\n",
    "* Python novices can focus on the modeling, without needing to know much about Python\n",
    "* Python experts can mix their models with other analytical frameworks, e.g. machine-learning toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say the new functionality seamlessly integrates with the rest of the BPTK PY framework, so you can use all the high-level scenario management and plotting functions which are part of the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I focus on how to build a System Dynamics model using the framework, I will take a look at Agent-based modeling in a future post.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple model to demonstrate the library\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the DSL, we will build the simple project management model we introduced in our [step-by-step tutorial on System Dynamics](https://www.transentis.com/step-by-step-tutorials/introduction-to-system-dynamics/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project management model is really simple and just containts a few stocks, flows and converters, as you can see in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of the Simple Project Management Model](simple_project_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So even if you don't know the model you should be able to follow this post very easily.\n",

    "To get started, we first need to import the library and in particular the SD function library into our notebook."
